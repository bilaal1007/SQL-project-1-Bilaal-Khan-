# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
Create and nurture a clean and readable data base to provide business insights for this ecommerce business. 

## Process
1 Import raw data 
2 Clean and process raw data for readability 
3 Answer business questions and provide insights from data using querys 
## Results
This data can tell me which products did well in which country and how many products were sold and where the most products were sold. This could let the ecommerce business decide properly on where to invest and where to liquidate their business.
## Challenges 
Main challenge was forseeing the data type while importing.
Also my device permissions for PGadmin gave me trouble


## Future Goals
I would make each query more presentable and organized 
I would also derive more insights from the data 
I would build a more accurate QA process to ensure the best data insights and analysis
